This was a scripted walkthrough I did for a video intro to Node.js and npm for [NewCircle](https://thenewcircle.com/). It's designed for users new to Node with a focus on doing something-anything-that-works. A handful of things are even done by-the-book, but the example focuses on exercising Node and a few third party packages.

The walkthrough/script is included and can be followed to build the simple app.

The completed bit of code is located in the `app-sprint` folder should you wish to skip the walkthrough and code dive.
