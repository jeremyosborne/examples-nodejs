# Examples

A set of examples corresponding to the name of the repo. These are examples that I have used in classes, to understand the subject at hand, or both.

Examples may be excellent, but are as likely to be inane, superfluous, and wrong outside of demonstrating something about the language/framework.



## My interpretation of the license.

Officially all code is [MIT licensed](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIT_License).

With that said, I don't care how you use the code. I have too many things to do to care. I'd be flattered if this code actually helps someone, anyone besides me.
