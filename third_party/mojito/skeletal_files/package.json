// !!!DO NOT SIMPLY CUT AND PASTE THIS FILE INTO YOUR CODE!!!
// JSON files do not allow comments, so these comments will break your
// app. Please delete this comment before using
// AND
// replace all bracketed tokens (e.g. <<<SOMETHING>>>) with info appropriate
// to your app.
// Notes about sections:
//    * The sections outside of the yahoo object are standard NPM contents 
//      that are used by both NPM and Manhattan.
//    * We are changing a lot of the file to be more consistent with both
//      Manhattan and NPM.
//    * Even if you are never going to publish your code to a repository via
//      (y)npm, it is a good practice to get comfortable with the package.json
//      file. It can make your life as a developer much, much easier.
// Notes about the bracketed tokens:
//     <<<APP_NAME>>> replace with your application name. This must be unique
//       across all of the dist system, hence why we name it this way for the
//       class.
//     <<<USERID>>> replace with your yahoo id to make sure your app
//       has a unique id (because we must dist the app before deploying
//       to Manhattan), and to fill in necessary contact info.
//     <<<NAME>>> replace with your full name.
