HELLO MY NAME IS LAB - WALKTHROUGH
==================================
* Exercise designed and tested with:
    * mojito 0.5.6
        * previous versions were tested with mojito 0.4.5
    * node.js 0.8.8
* Overview instructions are found in this file.
* Obvious comments are used to denote where code is added, changed, or 
  removed, EXCEPT in json files that do not allow comments (pay attention to 
  the notes in this file for JSON file changes).
* Remove this file from the distributed file packages.



STEPS FOR THE LAB
=================
* The steps for the lab are contained in "steps.txt".
* The steps.txt file is sterile, and assumes that the instructor knows, along
  with the completed files, enough to get through this step. This lab is
  designed to force nothing new on the students, but to give them the chance
  to go through and work with Mojito on their own.



NOTES ABOUT DEPLOYMENT
======================
* Once again, the finished version of this lab is purposefully not easily
  deployable because the error thrown by the default package.json is easier
  to begin debugging compared to a more correct, but conflicting, 
  package.json.
